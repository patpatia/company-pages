                    I am just about to complete six years. I believe every woman has an extra edge when it comes to multitasking and the same enhances their output in the IT industry. Accenture offers many benefits to its women employees such as maternity leave and surrogacy leave. It also ensures safety of women employees using the company transport.</br></br>
